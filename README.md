# Customer Segmentation - Clustering sample

## IMPORTANT: Its latest version is at the ML.NET Samples repo at https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-samples/tree/master/samples/csharp/getting-started/Clustering_CustomerSegmentation

## DataSet

The dataset is split in two files, which are located in assets / data

## Problem

This sample aims unsupervised problems. The dataset is split in two files, and the objective is to find customer segmentions based on previous customer transactions.

## ML Task - Clustering

The ML Task is Clustering, however, this example trains multiple models each one based on a different learner/algorithm and finally evaluates the accuracy of each approach, so you can choose the trained model with better accuracy.
The following list are the trainers/algorithms used and compared:
